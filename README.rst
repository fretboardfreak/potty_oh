Potty-Oh: Python Audio Programming Toolset
==========================================

Potty-Oh is a play on the phonetic pronunciation of the terms "P-Audio".
Libraries already exist with the unclever names pyaudio and paudio so I went
with something just a little different.

Potty-Oh is the result of my exploration into audio waveforms and how to
program various manipulations of audio.
